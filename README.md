# Project 1: Rates of Diabetes in the United States
* Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how the body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes - type 1, 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). According to CDC, more than 133 million in the United States live with diabetes, and 96 million out of 133 are US adults. 
* Based on studies conducted in the United States so far, there isnâ€™t a specific cure for diabetes yet, but weight management, good nutrition, and being active can improve the health outcome of a diabetic patient. 
* While previous studies focused on data at the individual level, the focus of our study was to examine the relationship between physical activity, food nutrition, and obesity on diabetes prognosis at the state level. 

## Research Questions
1. What are the rates of diabetes in the US?
2. Are there any differences in rates of diabetes between the four major regions of the 
United States?
3. How strong is the relationship between nutrition, physical activity, obesity and diabetes at the state level?
4. Can we predict diabetes rates at the state level based on nutrition rate, physical activity rates, and obesity rates?

## Process
1. Data Wrangling & Transformation
* Clean diabetes rate dataset.
* Clean nutrition, physical activity and dataset.
* Merged the two clean datasets.
2. Descriptive Analytics
* Describe the rates of diabetes in United States.
* Compare rates among United States regions.
3. Predictive Analytics
* Inspect relationship between nutrition, physical activity, obesity, and diabetes.
* Predict diabetes rates based on nutrition, physical activity, obesity and diabetes. 

## Understanding the Datasets
### Challenges
When researching the topic, we found multiple data sources but few captured the data we wanted to use.
We found two datasets that had the variables of interest, but they had different structures, and we needed to transform them to be a similar structure in order to merge them
### Dataset 1: 500 Cities: Adult Diabetes(csv)
Data was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. This project explores diabetes rates at the city level and includes sample size and population
Variables & Observations:
This dataset displays 24 columns, 29,006 rows in table. This dataset measures 50 states and 2 other US owned territories.
